            <p>
                My name is James Woodson Randall.  I was born in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine.
                I grew up in the town of Lexington SC, where I went to school and graduated from Lexington High.
                I played several sports growing up including soccer and football.  I met my wonderful wife while I
                was preparing to join the Marine Corps in Lexington.  We moved to Beaufort in 2015 and started our
                family in 2016, when my first daughter, Lorelei, was born.  In March of 2017, my second daughter
                Julianna was born. Both of my parents still live in Lexington SC.
                My most significant role is husband and father, and I spend much of my time and energy doing family
                related activities. In addition however, I have several interests that I’ve been involved with for much
                of my life, including drawing, working on computers, and repairing cell phones.  These interests led me
                to pursue an Associates degree in Mechanical Design, and certifications in both AutoCAD and SolidWorks.
                Currently I am pursuing my Bachelors degree in Computational Science from the University of South
                Carolina Beaufort (USCB).
                <br>
                <br>
                My hope is that once graduating, I can begin working in the technology industry where I can apply what
                I have learned in both Mechanical Design and Computer Science.  I have a keen interest in the area of CAD,
                Computer Graphics, and AI. I have developed skills in 2D and 3D design, and have experience with 3D printing.
                I have assisted in the creation of home plan designs, as well as designs for furniture and cabinetry. I am
                currently expanding my knowledge base with expertise in coding, networks, and security.
                I look forward to the technology future filled with opportunities in a multitude of fields, and being able to
                make significant contributions to it’s use and the overall benefit of society as a whole.
